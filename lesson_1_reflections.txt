How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed me the differences between the files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I may want to go back and use something I did in a previous version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: rational human judgment as opposed to stupid machine.
	 cons: human error (not saving enough)

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    different uses. git is more for coding, which often involves a group of files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    use git log to view commit history and git diff to compare 2 commits by id.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    in that it's ok to try things even if i break something because i can always find
	 where a bug entered and go back and fix it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    a project with Billie!!
